	abstract = {Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing protocols have dramatically increased the throughput of single-cell transcriptomics studies. A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that EmptyDrops has greater power than existing approaches while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. Our method also retains distinct cell types that would have been discarded by existing methods in several real data sets.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Droplet-based scRNA-seq assays are known to produce a significant amount of background RNA counts, the hallmark of which is non-zero transcript counts in presumably empty droplets. The presence of background RNA can lead to systematic biases and batch effects in various downstream analyses such as differential expression and marker gene discovery. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in droplet-based scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package. Finally, we present simulations and investigations of several scRNA-seq datasets to show that processing raw data using CellBender significantly boosts the magnitude and specificity of differential expression across different cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
